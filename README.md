# Daily Expenses Sharing Application

## Overview

The Daily Expenses Sharing Application is a Django-based web application that allows users to manage and share daily expenses. Users can add expenses and split them using three different methods: exact amounts, percentages, and equal splits. The application also supports generating and downloading balance sheets.

## Features

- **User Management**: Create and manage user profiles with email, name, and mobile number.
- **Expense Management**: Add and manage expenses with different split methods.
- **Expense Splits**: Split expenses equally, by exact amounts, or by percentages.
- **Balance Sheets**: Generate and download balance sheets.
- **Filtering**: Retrieve expenses for a specific user based on query parameters.
